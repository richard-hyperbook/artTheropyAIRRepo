App Brief: Simple AIR Video Maker for Art Therapists
Purpose
A very simple app that helps art therapists create a short Audio-Image Recording (AIR) video with a client at the end of therapy.
The app is only a creation tool — not a client record system.

It combines:

2 Photos of artwork

Recorded voice reflections

A fixed sequence of guided questions

The final result is a short video that is shared with the client and then removed from the device.

Core Features (Must Have)
1. Image Capture
   Take photos inside the app or upload from camera roll

Add multiple images

Rearrange image order easily (drag and drop)

2. Voice Recording
   Record audio within the app

One recording per question/section

Very simple editing only:

Trim start/end

Delete and re-record

Cut and paste sections if possible (basic, not advanced editing)

3. Voice-to-Text (Optional Captioning)
   Automatic speech-to-text transcription

Text appears as optional captions on screen

Therapist can lightly edit the text if needed

4. Fixed Question Template
   The app must include a built-in structured sequence of screens with these questions:

Start of Therapy

“Could you say a few words about how you were when you started art therapy?”

Artwork 1

“Could you say something about this first piece?”

“At what point in therapy did you make this?”

“What was it like making this piece in art therapy?”

Artwork 2

“Could you say something about this second piece?”

“At what point in therapy did you make this?”

“What was it like making this piece in art therapy?”

Change Between the Two

“What would you say changed for you between these two times?”

End of Therapy

“Could you say a few words about how you are now?”

“What changes have you experienced from your art therapy?”

How Art Therapy Helped

“What is it about art therapy that made those changes happen?”

Other Therapy (Optional Section Therapist Can Skip)

“Have you had any other sort of therapy?”

“How was art therapy different from that therapy?”

Final Reflection

“Is there anything else you would like to mention?”

Each section allows:
📸 Image (where relevant)
🎙 Audio response

5. Automatic Video Creation
   App automatically combines:

Images

Recorded audio

Optional text captions

Simple slideshow style

Gentle transitions only (no complex editing tools)

6. Sharing
   Export as a video file

Easy sharing options:

Airdrop
